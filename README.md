# My dotfiles, managed by [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi)

## What we try to achieve

- be as distribution/OS-agnostic as possible. The only requirement - ideally - should be [mise](https://https://mise.jdx.dev/) to install everything we need.
- be as declarative as possible. This can't be nix nor home-manager, but on the bright side - we don't have to be as straight as nix and can keep our day job.
